form.newRegistration.section2.text1=<b>We will send you a link to pay the registration fee, your username, and basic registration and library services information to your email</b>.

form.newRegistration.section2.text2=We primarily use the phone number in cases where you forget your belongings in the study room or cloakroom, as it is the quickest way to notify you of this situation.
