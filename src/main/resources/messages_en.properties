form.newRegistration.section1.title=BASIC IDENTIFICATION DATA
form.newRegistration.section1.subtitle=Legal basis: fulfillment of the contract
form.newRegistration.section1.text1=All these data serve to conclude the contract. Without their transfer, we will not be able to register you via BankID, but you can use <a href="https://www.lib.cas.cz/sluzby/vypujcni-sluzby/registrace/" target="_blank">another method of registration</a>.
form.newRegistration.section2.title=CONTACT INFORMATION
form.newRegistration.section2.subtitle=Legal basis: fulfillment of the contract
form.newRegistration.section2.text1=<b>We will send you a link to pay the registration fee, your username, and basic registration and library services information to your email</b>. The same information will also be displayed to you after submitting the registration form, so it will be <b>available once</b> even without providing an email. At the same time, we send messages related to services and registration via email (pickup and return dates, end of registration, individual study room rentals, or even information about automatic loan extensions).
form.newRegistration.section2.text2=We primarily use the phone number in cases where you forget your belongings in the study room or cloakroom, as it is the quickest way to notify you of this situation. We also use it, along with the contact address, for resolving outstanding obligations out of court. It is up to you whether you provide us with this information, as you can freely add, modify, and delete it in your user account.
form.newRegistration.section3.title=LIBRARY CARD (MIFARE RFID tag identifier of the card)
form.newRegistration.section3.subtitle=Legal basis: fulfillment of the contract
form.newRegistration.section3.text1=For study room visits and borrowing books to take home, you will need a library card, which can be your valid bank card with a chip and contactless technology, or your third-party chip card, such as: ISIC card, Lítačka, IN card from Czech Railways, etc. You can register it either in this form or during your first visit to the study room with our staff. If you don't have such a card or don’t want to use it, you can have a KNAV library card issued in the study room.
form.newRegistration.section3.block1.h=Library Card Registration
form.newRegistration.section3.block1.text=In the "Identifier value" field, enter the string you can find in the mobile application. After completing the registration, you can start using your card as a library card immediately without any additional steps.

After installing and launching the app, place the phone near the card and copy the UID value (the string might look like <b>08D4EED6</b>, but it could be longer or shorter). Ignore the message "Not a MIFARE Classic tag!".
form.newRegistration.section3.block3.h=iOS
form.newRegistration.section3.block3.text=On an iOS phone, use an app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a>. After installing and launching the app, place the phone near the card and copy the value from the "Serial number" field, marked with a key icon. When copying the string, omit the colons (the string displayed as 04:F4:F6:2A:9E:4A:80 should be copied as: <b>04F4F62A9E4A80</b>).
